This is a "capture the flag" style trainer app that will help familiarize you with the basics of Android security. The application is divided into lessons; feel free to go through the lessons in any order you wish.

Please note that you may want to download an auxiliary application for Lesson 8. It will be posted to the Google Play shortly.

For those of you who are stuck - we will be posting a walk-through soon for IGLearner, please check back at https://www.intrepidusgroup.com/insight

Some tips on what tools can be useful when you are taking this app apart:

- Android SDK
- apktool
- Dex2Jar
- JD-GUI
- Any local HTTP proxy - we like Burp Suite, but you can use anything you wish (Paros etc.)
- Virtuous Ten Studio to look at the smali code
